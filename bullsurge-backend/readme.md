_**Frontend (Angular):**_

1. Start by creating a login/register page using Angular components, where users can create an account or log in using social media or Google login. You can utilize Angular routing to navigate between different pages.
2. Design a dashboard page to display the user's financial information, such as income, expenses, and savings. Use Angular components to present the data in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner.
3. Implement a form using Angular Reactive Forms to allow users to add new income and expense entries. Capture the necessary details such as transaction type, amount, category, and date.
4. Use Angular services to communicate with the backend APIs, making HTTP requests to retrieve and update financial data.
5. Develop a transaction history page to display the user's past transactions. Implement features like filtering and sorting to enhance usability.


**_Backend (Spring Boot):_**

1. Develop RESTful APIs using Spring Boot and Spring MVC to handle user authentication, registration, and data retrieval. Define endpoints for user 
   login, registration, and retrieving financial data.
2. Implement API endpoints for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting income and expense entries. These endpoints will communicate with the 
   frontend to perform the necessary operations on the MongoDB database.
3. Secure the APIs using JWT-based authentication. Users will receive a token upon successful login, which they will include in subsequent 
   API requests to authenticate themselves.
4. Utilize Spring Data MongoDB to connect to the MongoDB database. Define models and repositories to represent the financial 
   transactions and perform database operations.


_**Database (MongoDB):**_

1. Set up a MongoDB database to store user account information, income, and expense data. Install MongoDB locally or use a cloud-based MongoDB service.
2. Design a suitable database schema to represent the financial transactions. Define collections and documents to store user account details, income entries, and expense entries.
3. Establish a connection between your Spring Boot application and the MongoDB database by configuring the database connection properties.


_**Deployment (AWS):**_

1. To host your application on AWS, you can follow these general steps:
2. Set up an AWS account and navigate to the AWS Management Console.
3. Utilize AWS services like Elastic Beanstalk, Amazon EC2, or AWS Fargate to deploy your Spring Boot backend application.
4. Use AWS S3 or CloudFront to host your Angular frontend application, or consider deploying it as a static website on AWS S3.
5. Configure security groups, load balancers, and other necessary settings to ensure your application's availability and security on AWS.
6. Remember to handle error scenarios gracefully, implement validation on the frontend and backend, and conduct thorough testing throughout the development process to ensure your application is robust and reliable.
